# Classification_Project

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and developed and tested a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict employee attrition in a company, leveraging K-Fold Cross Validation to optimize K and also applied weighted KNN. Enhanced the model performance through hyperparameter tuning, however, achieving the same accuracy with weighted KNN.
